<!-- Write and host a single web-page that should run on a smart phone,
implementing (in front-end javascript, not server-side) a basic calculator
function. This does not need to be beautiful, but must support at least the
following operations:      +  -  *  /   %  ^   SQRT.
[By % and ^, we mean "modulo" and "to the power of"]
It must detect and notify of illegal input (e.g. sqrt(-1)).
Serve it up, on your own domain, over https. -->
